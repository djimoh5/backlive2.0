        <h3>The Platform</h3>
        <p>
            BackLive is a web-based platform for sophisticated retail and professional investors that facilitates the backtesting, 
            analysis, and execution of complex stock market trading strategies. Current access to state-of-the art stock strategy implementation 
            requires either an in-house team of programmers or software that is often too costly, in-flexible, or cumbersome to use. 
            BackLive remedies this situation by providing online access to sophisticated tools that obscure the complexities 
            involved with building and validating superior trading strategies.

        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            Individuals across all walks of life frequently make false assumptions that lead to inaccurate and often costly predictions of future 
            outcomes. BackLive’s philosophy is to let the data speak first. By creating virtual test environments that strive to replicate as 
            closely as possible the conditions and parameters of a past period, BackLive provides valuable insights that inform 
            intelligent decision making in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the stock market, even when investors do have access to all the data necessary to make informed decisions, they are often 
            misled as to what factors truly drive superior returns, unaware that some of these factors may change over time, or lack the tools 
            to explore their own ideas. BackLive’s mission is to provide investors with the power to quickly separate weak strategies from those 
            that are likely to be profitable, without the need for a team of analysts or programmers. When an “expert” on a financial TV network 
            or blog touts a stock because it ranks high on any given metric, BackLive’s goal is to answer the question, “how would a strategy of 
            selecting stocks based on this metric actually have performed?”
